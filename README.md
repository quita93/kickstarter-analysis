* My finding are as follows: Well there were many successful campaign runs the most sucessful outcomes came from the technology catergory. My analysis shows that the technology catergory had the most backers and the highest success rate compared to any other catergory. My recommendation would be to continue to focus your means on this catergory as it has a greater chance of a better outcome. My research also finds that the theater catergory also yielded high results. You may also find it nessacary to direct you means there.
