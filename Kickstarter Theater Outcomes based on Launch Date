# Kickstarter Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
### The purpose of this is analysis is to show Louise how her campaigns performed based on the funding goals she set and their respective creation date.
## I performed my analysis by first filtering which projects were successful, failed and canceled based on the months or the year and per the theater using a pivot table. I then determined how many projects were successful, failed and canceled as well as their respective percentages based on a value amount range. I then graphed both datasets for visualization. I did have difficulties filtering the data within the pivot table per the month as the information is not directly given within the dataset, but I was able to sort within the pivot table to achieve the desired outcome.
### My conclusion regarding the Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart are as follows: Firstly, the months of May and June have the highest success rates which are almost double the rate for most of the other months. These two also have some of the higher rates in the failed category but not the highest. They also average about the same as the other months in failed. I would conclude that these two months yielded promising results based on the success rate vs how many canceled and/or failed. Secondly, the month of January yielded not very high numbers is the success category, high numbers in failed and the highest of all months in canceled. I would not conclude that the launch dates in this month yielded promising results.

### My conclusion regarding the Outcomes based on goals is as follows: The lower the goal amount the higher the success rate and higher the failure rate. I would conclude that the less the goal amount yields more data which I would assume means there was a higher response rate with a lower goal number.

### I don’t believe there were any limitations of the dataset as I was able to make accurate conclusions based on the information that was provided. I would recommend using a box and whisper graph to provide a more accurate depiction of your data and see common themes. A pie graph may also be helpful in seeing a high-level visualization of how much each project brings in.
